* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Materialize CSS](materializecss.com)

The entire course is focused in Angular JS only, I made a few changes and added other related technologies to make it easier to use and to get a better user interface.

### What should I be able to do in this project

I must be able to search for a Github username and get a list of public repositories from the selected user.

When clicking on a repository name you must be able to see some details of it and the list of it's contributors.
